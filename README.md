# Model Exploration and Regression Analysis

Welcome to our Model Exploration and Regression Analysis project! This repository is dedicated to exploring a variety of machine learning models to tackle a specific regression problem, with a particular focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR) using a Linear kernel. I leverage scikit-learn for model implementation and the Weights & Biases (W&B) toolkit for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to investigate different machine learning models' performance on a regression task, fine-tune hyperparameters, and identify the most effective model. While my exploration includes various models, I place a special emphasis on fine-tuning and analyzing Support Vector Regression with a Linear kernel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- scikit-learn
- Weights & Biases toolkit
